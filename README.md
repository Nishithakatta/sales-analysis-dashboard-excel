# Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-Excel

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a dynamic sales dashboard using an 8-year historical dataset. The dashboard delivers key insights into company sales performance, shipping timelines, and regional distribution patterns. By leveraging Power Query and Power Pivot in Microsoft Excel, the solution handles large-scale data efficiently. The dashboard is tailored to support strategic decision-making related to shipping and sales optimization.

## Dataset Used
The dataset includes **1 million rows** and **13 columns**, capturing 8 years of historical sales data. Core fields include order dates, shipping dates, revenue, profit, transaction details, and COGS (Cost of Goods Sold). All data resides in a single table, with Power Query facilitating data transformation before passing it to Power Pivot for in-depth analysis and scalability.

## Key Steps in the Project

### Data Extraction and Transformation
- **Power Query**: Used to pull in and reshape raw data into a clean, tabular format.
- **Custom & Conditional Fields**: Created logic-based fields to enhance dataset readiness for analysis.

### Data Compilation and Analysis
- **Power Pivot**: Employed for high-performance storage and modeling of large datasets.
- **Excel Functions**: Used advanced functions like `OFFSET` and `COUNTA` to create dynamic reports summarizing transactions, orders, revenue, and profits by time period and category.
- **Pivot Tables**: Developed to efficiently summarize financial metrics.

### Dashboard Development
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built an Excel dashboard with visual elements to explore trends and patterns.
- **KPIs**: Designed summary cards showing key metrics such as total transactions, revenue, orders, COGS, and profit.
- **Dynamic Views**: Enabled detailed analysis by week, month, category, and geography.
- **Option Buttons**: Added interactivity to switch between metrics and filters (region, item type, time period).
